If your breath starts to stink just a few hours after

you brush your teeth,

then you need to start oil pulling.

The reason your breath still stinks

is because there is still bacteria

in your mouth that your toothbrush alone can't reach.

And that's where the oil pulling kit

from Guru Nanda comes in.

Not only will you get a highly effective oral rinse

that gets in every crack and crevice of your mouth,

but you will also get a tongue scraper

to remove that nasty

white bacteria off the surface of your tongue.

Most people don't use a tongue scraper

and that is where your breath can differ.

Plus, after one week of use

you will start to notice

your teeth getting whiter from the oral solution.

I went ahead and linked the oil pulling kit

by Guru Nanda below.

Available for purchase on the TikTok Shop right now.

Stop the weight

and fix your breath today!
